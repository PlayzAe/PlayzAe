Welcome to my corner of the web. I'm a **C# Backend Developer** with a passion for **Web APIs** and **MVC** applications, but I also dabble in **Motion Graphics** and **Anime** (because coding can get a bit too serious sometimes, right?). 😎

## 🎥 Anime Lover 💥
When I’m not coding or animating, I’m diving into the world of anime. My all-time favorite is **Monster**, where the psychological drama unfolds with Johan as the chilling antagonist. Seriously, if you love gripping plots, psychological thrillers, and mind-bending twists, you gotta check it out.

Here’s a meme sticker to keep things fun, featuring *Monster*:
